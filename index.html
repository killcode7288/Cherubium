        <h1 class="text-center text">WHY ARE WE COMING TO SOLANA FROM VECHAIN?</h1>
        <p>The main reason why we choose the Solana network is that we want to achieve greater things. At Vechain, our project has reached a very good position within 7 months and is still ongoing. Our holders NFTs exceeded 3 times over the mint price. At the same time, our investors got 51% of their money back with our monthly passive income. We established our system and Tradze Town continues successfully.</p>
        <p>Now, we want to appeal to a large audience in Solana, with a more professional and larger team. While the nft trading volume on Vechain is only $3000 per day, the volume on the solana network can exceed 100,000 solana per day. While many projects went bankrupt during the bear market because they were not sustainable, we proved our sustainability with the system we established. And we achieved this success in a very low volume market. We will be able to continue with the same system in Solana and expand our project even more. In this way, the size of the collaborations we can make and the advantages we can provide to our holders will increase exponentially.</p>
